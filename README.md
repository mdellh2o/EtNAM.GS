# EtNAM.GS
Scripts for genomic selection and QTL mapping using the EtNAM population 

This repo contains a set of R scripts used to analyze data produced on the Ethiopian nested association mapping population (EtNAM) as well as data produced on a diversity panel of Ethiopian wheat landraces.
Scripts point to my local computer, but are arranged to allow to easily changing the working directory to that of choice.
Associated data is both on this GitHub repo as well as on Dryad with DOI:10.5061/dryad.w6m905qrv
